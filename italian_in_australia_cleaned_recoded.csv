Also one day I hope to do my own travels with friends, and I would like to be able to speak the language because I am in another country. I feel as though when foreigners come to Australia we expect them to be able to speak our language so why should it be any different the other way around if I were travelling to their country. 

Studying Italian could also allow me to keep my options open, like whether i would like to work over seas or not.

I am a third generation immigrant and my Nanna is bilingual speaking both English and Italian. I find that this is a way for me to connect with a side of my family (both in Australia, Italy and Argentina) on a personal level through writing and speaking Italian and from a general cultural level as well. It excites me to understand Italian lifestyle and people more than I believe I could from an English only perspective. It will allow me to also be more injected and involved, while also developing myself from what the language and culture holds.","I see the strong advantages of having a birth lottery land me in an English speaking family and society. I think it already has a strong global relevance with its emergence as a global language. However I think people in Australia and other English speakers take this for granted. A mindset and worldview can become very centred on what we can identify and explain with our primary language. Learning Italian at a university level will allow me to gain a greater perspective on the world and my place within it while also gaining insight into an Italian view of the world. I'm glad that it has already connected me with fellow students and staff who are at varying levels of Italian proficiency but all share a desire to learn and develop. It would allow me to extend this community with my family, my friends and my fellows. I hope that it will also be further inspiration for me to visit Italy at the same time as a future in travel and occupation will inspire me to keep learning Italian. I hope to work and study in Italy in the near future and taking classes will add to a sense of fulfilment",Firstly I hope to be able to share a language with my grandparents and relatives. I have never conversed in Italian at a family gather or face to face with a family member since I study away from home. While I'm unsure of my career trajectory my university has many international opportunities. I hope to take an exchange to Fiorenze (go Fiorentina!) or Venezia to continue my course and Italian studies. While there I hope it will allow me to be more of a contributor to Italy than a voyeur.
