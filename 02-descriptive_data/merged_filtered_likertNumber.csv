The other choice was Indonesian which didn't appeal to me at all. So I chose German! I always found German extremely enjoyable and quite easy to understand, which confused me when everyone was telling me how hard German is to learn. I still found it not as challenging as everyone made me think it would be in year 12, however now at uni with all the extensions on my knowledge of grammar I see what everyone was talking about!
I stuck with German because I think it is so special and such an invaluable skill to be able to speak two or more languages. The more I learnt about German the more I liked about it, how it was much more widely spoken than I previously thought, and the country itself interested me immensely. 
Germany is an extremely well known country and has always been a powerful nation full of highly acclaimed scientists, writers, you name it. I really identify with Germany for their environmental consciousness as well, they are so fantastic with recycling and reducing waste efforts. 
I feel that learning another language never felt like a burden to me, I always enjoyed doing homework and viewed it as such an immense privilege. School can be really demotivating for me when I can't see the immediate connection between what I'm learning and it's application to the real world. That's why learning a language gets me so excited, because I can immediately apply what I've learnt, it's all so relevant!","After a gap year where I spent a lot of time in Germany, I saw the value in learning German, how special it was to be able to communicate with the locals. It made me feel special as well because it's quite unusual for an Australian with no German family members to be able to speak it. It surprised a lot of the locals, and one lady even said she'd never meant an Australian who spoke such good German! 
That just made me more determined to continue improving my language skills and bettering myself. To study German at university opens so many doors career wise. Since I don't see myself using German in my future job (who knows though!) it's even just so exciting to know that I could take opportunities to teach english in Germany for a gap year here or there. Just to have options open like that, it's great to know German is a skill I can fall back on!
I now am tutoring year 12 students with German so it has helped me to earn some extra money, but more than that has helped me to remain current with my skills and hopefully be able to pass my enthusiasm and love of German on to someone else.","I think German will always have a role in my future, I want to continually improve my skills and just become better and better. I think I will definitely travel to Germany again in the future, maybe to work and travel, but I know I never want to lose the valuable skill that is being able to converse in German. 
I am still very unsure about what future career I want to have, so maybe German will be a part of that!
It's also been an opener for me to want to study other languages, Spanish and Italian are next. Choosing to continue with German throughout high school and now university is a decision I will never ever regret, but rather be so thankful that I did. 
I even think about my future children and how valuable it would be for them to grow up with exposure to another language, so I'd love to teach them German as well.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,0,"0",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,NA,"18-25","Female","English","No","No","Yes",NA,"4-6 years",NA,0,0,NA,NA,"HUM","Intermediate",0,0,"German in Australia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1st year",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Agree","Not sure","Agree","Not sure",0,1,0,0,0,NA,"Yes",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Philosophy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1st year","1st year","German 5 (Melbourne University)",NA,"MINOR.BREADTH",NA,NA,NA,"Bachelor of Arts with German as a minor/breadth subject",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1,"No",4,4,4,5,1,3,1,1,5,2,5,5,3,5,3,3,5,2,5,3,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,NA,4,3,4,3

There were not many language options in high school, so I studied German because it was the only European language option. When I came to university, I knew I wanted to study a language and that I'd like to achieve some level of proficiency. I decided to continue with German, rather than starting a new language, because I thought it would be better to fully concentrate on one language, rather than have bits and pieces of knowledge over a few languages. I'm really happy I did, because I've always really liked German as a language - I enjoy studying it and speaking it and every time I 'conquer' a new bit of grammar, I feel like I've really accomplished something.","Honestly, I don't think German is the most *useful* language for business or travel, there are other languages that are more commonly spoken and may lead to more possible future careers, I suppose. But I think learning German also improves my English and my understanding of the world, from a European perspective and an intercultural perspective. Exposure to German literature and film university-level also helps my comprehension and critical thinking more (as I am not studying literature aside from that). I also really like Germany and it feels wonderful to be able to communicate with people there, rather than assuming they know English or want to speak English (as can often be the case).","I have travelled to Germany a few times and would love to go again. I just love the environment, the lifestyle, and I love being able to interact with people in their language, I feel like it's a better experience. I don't know if there is any future for me with German professionally speaking, but I feel it's always an advantage to have a second language, even just from the perspective of hopefully being a better intercultural communicator. Australia has become so multicultural, that even a workplace here would most likely include some level of intercultural interaction.

I started with English, and now I am thinking of learning Italian, French and Spanish. I will do one at a time, and right now it's Italian. 

Main motivation: interest. The Renaissance started in Italy, and I am obsessed with art and art related history. I want to be able to visit the country that gave birth to the Renaissance one day, speaking the country's language as if I was born there. I don't want to visit a country feeling like I am a foreigner. I wan to go to Italy feeling like I am just visiting an old home of mine. 

Also, I love Italian food. Studying italian gives me confidence when I order food in italian restaurants. Now I am able to take my fiance to all the nicest little italian restaurants and cafes and teach him a few sentences while we have dinner. (feels good man)","Learning Italian, going to Italian tutorials is a great opportunity to meet people of similar interests. Many people from my tutorial either have Italian backgrounds or are intrigued with the Italian language and culture. Mixing in with such people gives me a sense of belonging. 

also, as a science student (I am doing physics, chemistry and biology all together), the four hours of Italian tutorial throughout the week is a great ""mind refresher"" for me. Studying Italian increases my productivity. 

In addition, studying languages is beneficial for brain development and slows down brain ageing, which is advantageous for not just university level, but for a whole life time.","As mentioned before, Italian is a tool. Using this tool, I will be able to travel to Italian, walk on the streets of Florence, Rome and Tuscany, visit all the beautiful places without feeling like a tourist, but feeling like a local.

I believe this is important because I want to be able to understand and interact with as many people as possible from all corners of the globe, learning about the human experience and how different language and cultural conditions shape different people. German also features prominantly in my desired future career of living in Europe as a language teacher.","I think a disadvantage to only beginning to learn German at university level is that I am not as adaptable to grammar and speech variations as I was when I was younger. That is to say that because I have been surrounded by only English for so long I have internalised and so think in terms of English grammar rules and sound associations for example to me a tree has always been called a tree. Hence it is an entirely new process for me to have to now conciously put so much effort in to remembering that it is 'ein Baum' in German. Another tricky aspect has been associating words with gendered articles. More specific to the challenges of explicitly being an English speaker learning German, especially in Australia, is the fact that there is very little foreign content available and almost none of it is exposed in mainstream media. This is centred around the idea that, as a native English speaker, you don't need to 'waste time' on learning another language because the general consensus is that 'everyone else is learning English anyway'. There is also the challenge that because so many people worldwide learn English, finding a German speaking person willing to struggle through a conversation with you in German is very difficult.","German will hopefully play a very prominant role in my future.

I think it already has a strong global relevance with its emergence as a global language. However I think people in Australia and other English speakers take this for granted. A mindset and worldview can become very centred on what we can identify and explain with our primary language. Learning Italian at a university level will allow me to gain a greater perspective on the world and my place within it while also gaining insight into an Italian view of the world. I'm glad that it has already connected me with fellow students and staff who are at varying levels of Italian proficiency but all share a desire to learn and develop. It would allow me to extend this community with my family, my friends and my fellows. I hope that it will also be further inspiration for me to visit Italy at the same time as a future in travel and occupation will inspire me to keep learning Italian.
