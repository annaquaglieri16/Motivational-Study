Since I was a child I always wanted to become a tourist guide in London, because I love the culture, the city and the history of England, but growing up I started thinking about myself as a writer, not because I think I can become a worlwide famous writer, but because I love writing down my ideas, my feelings and emotions and to trasform them in a story. 
What I always believed is that if I can speak and write good in English my possibilities to realise my dreams are more and more everyday.","Italian is a language spoken only in Italy, but English is the language of the world, everyone can speak English, even if at different levels, so if I can speak it pretty well I can relate to people form all over the world and the more I know it, the more I can realte to different levels of speaking, and also in different subjects. 
With an English at university level I have more possibility to speak and relate, so probably I will also have more possibilities in the future to find a better job.","I hope that one day I will move to an English-speaking country, possibly in England, because since I was a child that was my dream, but now that I grew up I hope that in my future I will have a good job for which I can travel a lot around the world, and for this reason it's important to be able to speak at least English very well.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,QC,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,NA,18-25,Female,Italian,Yes,French and Spanish,French,No,NA,Kindergarten,NA,0,0,0,0,L2.RESOURCES; MEDIA,Lingue e letterature straniere,NA,First or second language,NA,1st year,Upper-intermediate,NA,0,0,1,NA,English in Italy,NA,QC,NA,NA,L2.RESOURCES; MEDIA

They have nothing in common and this is an advantage from my point of view. When you learn a language completely different from yours, you start understanding how the system of languages works and you'll find easier, next time, learning another one (Arabic, Russian, Chinese).
