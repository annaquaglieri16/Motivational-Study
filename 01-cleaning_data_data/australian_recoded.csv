The other choice was Indonesian which didn't appeal to me at all. So I chose German! I always found German extremely enjoyable and quite easy to understand, which confused me when everyone was telling me how hard German is to learn. I still found it not as challenging as everyone made me think it would be in year 12, however now at uni with all the extensions on my knowledge of grammar I see what everyone was talking about!
I stuck with German because I think it is so special and such an invaluable skill to be able to speak two or more languages. The more I learnt about German the more I liked about it, how it was much more widely spoken than I previously thought, and the country itself interested me immensely. 
Germany is an extremely well known country and has always been a powerful nation full of highly acclaimed scientists, writers, you name it. I really identify with Germany for their environmental consciousness as well, they are so fantastic with recycling and reducing waste efforts. 
I feel that learning another language never felt like a burden to me, I always enjoyed doing homework and viewed it as such an immense privilege. School can be really demotivating for me when I can't see the immediate connection between what I'm learning and it's application to the real world. That's why learning a language gets me so excited, because I can immediately apply what I've learnt, it's all so relevant!","After a gap year where I spent a lot of time in Germany, I saw the value in learning German, how special it was to be able to communicate with the locals. It made me feel special as well because it's quite unusual for an Australian with no German family members to be able to speak it. It surprised a lot of the locals, and one lady even said she'd never meant an Australian who spoke such good German! 
That just made me more determined to continue improving my language skills and bettering myself. To study German at university opens so many doors career wise. Since I don't see myself using German in my future job (who knows though!) it's even just so exciting to know that I could take opportunities to teach english in Germany for a gap year here or there. Just to have options open like that, it's great to know German is a skill I can fall back on!
I now am tutoring year 12 students with German so it has helped me to earn some extra money, but more than that has helped me to remain current with my skills and hopefully be able to pass my enthusiasm and love of German on to someone else.","I think German will always have a role in my future, I want to continually improve my skills and just become better and better. I think I will definitely travel to Germany again in the future, maybe to work and travel, but I know I never want to lose the valuable skill that is being able to converse in German. 
I am still very unsure about what future career I want to have, so maybe German will be a part of that!
It's also been an opener for me to want to study other languages, Spanish and Italian are next. Choosing to continue with German throughout high school and now university is a decision I will never ever regret, but rather be so thankful that I did. 
I even think about my future children and how valuable it would be for them to grow up with exposure to another language, so I'd love to teach them German as well.",0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,NA,"18-25","Female","English","No","No","Yes",NA,0,1,0,0,0,NA,"Yes",NA,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Philosophy",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1st year","1st year","GermanÂ 5Â (Melbourne University)","Intermediate","4-6 years","German in Australia",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"HUM","MINOR.BREADTH",NA,NA,NA,"Bachelor of Arts with German as a minor/breadth subject",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

German also features prominantly in my desired future career of living in Europe as a language teacher.","I think a disadvantage to only beginning to learn German at university level is that I am not as adaptable to grammar and speech variations as I was when I was younger.

Hence it is an entirely new process for me to have to now conciously put so much effort in to remembering that it is 'ein Baum' in German. Another tricky aspect has been associating words with gendered articles. More specific to the challenges of explicitly being an English speaker learning German, especially in Australia, is the fact that there is very little foreign content available and almost none of it is exposed in mainstream media. This is centred around the idea that, as a native English speaker, you don't need to 'waste time' on learning another language because the general consensus is that 'everyone else is learning English anyway'. There is also the challenge that because so many people worldwide learn English, finding a German speaking person willing to struggle through a conversation with you in German is very difficult.","German will hopefully play a very prominant role in my future.
